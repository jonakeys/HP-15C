Find Armstrong / narcissistic numbers

* Exercise text from "Short & Sweet Math Challenges for HP fans #3"

Find *all* numbers of N digits that are equal to the sum of the N-th powers of
their digits. You must find the numbers themselves, as well as just how many
there are for each N. The digit 0 *won't* be accepted as first digit, so for
instance 153 may be a solution for N=3 but 032 wouldn't even be tested.

** Answers:
1 : 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
2 : (none)
3 : 153 370 371 407
4 : 1634 8208 9474

** How to use:
Enter an integer and press f LBL A to start the search. When a valid number is
found, the display pauses and shows this number. The output is 0 when finished.
